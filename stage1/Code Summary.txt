write_output(): Writes the selected move to output.txt.
fetch_known_valid_moves(): Identifies legal moves.
inquire_valid_move(): Checks move validity (KO & Liberty rules).
has_liberty(): Ensures the move doesn’t result in self-capture.
remove_dead_stones(): Removes opponent stones with no liberties.
evaluate_board(): Scores board position (favors player’s stones and liberties).
minimax(): Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for decision-making.
produce_next_best_move(): Controls the process (read input, compute move, write output).

Summary:
The Stage 1 agent is built using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, optimized for fast decision-making with a branching factor of 5.
