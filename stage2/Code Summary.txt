Stage 2 (Enhanced Minimax with Higher Branching Factor)

Improvements Over Stage 1:
Branching Factor Increased: 12 (allows deeper search for better moves).
Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm.
Time Constraint: 9.8 seconds per move.

Functions Used (Similar as Stage 1 but optimized for more possibilities):
fetch_known_valid_moves(): Fetches more possible moves.
move_heuristic(): Prioritizes capturing stones and center control.
minimax(): Improved decision-making with a wider move search.

Summary:
The Stage 2 agent improves upon it by increasing the branching factor to 12, allowing for better strategy execution.
